Features:

* record loops for a while
* multiple versions of the same thing
* set tempo from midi clock or tap tempo
* slice the loop according to the tempo (in semis/minims/crotchets/quavers/whateves)
* play it back with fx
  * stutter (volume)
  * reverse
  * swap
  * or general LV2 fx
* LFO to automate the fx: each effect has 'threshold'/'probability' input following the signal
* some effects have a 2nd parameter that the random can also route to
* finally a "random" effect routes the trigger signal to a random effect each time
* I guess you can also automate the length of the slices

To implement:

* Initial C implementation; GStreamer good for initial work
